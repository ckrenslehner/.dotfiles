Dotfiles directory for cross-platform development using [rotz](https://github.com/volllly/rotz) as dotfile manager.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install [rotz](https://github.com/volllly/rotz)
3. Run `rotz install` to install the tools
4. Run `rotz link` to link the dotfiles directory to your home directory

## Testing 

You can use the `--dry-run` flag to test the correctness of the files

- `rotz --dry-run install` - This will show you what files would be installed without actually installing them
- `rotz --dry-run link` - This will show you what files would be linked without actually linking them
